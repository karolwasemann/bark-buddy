# Repository Guidelines

Next.js 16 application (React 19, TypeScript 5, Tailwind CSS 4) using the App Router. Bootstrapped with `create-next-app`.

## Hard Rules

- **Next.js 16 has breaking changes.** APIs, conventions, and file structure may differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing any Next.js code. Heed deprecation notices.
- Do not introduce a Pages Router (`pages/` directory). This project uses App Router exclusively.
- Do not add CSS Modules or styled-components. Use Tailwind utility classes for all styling.

## Build & Development

See @package.json `scripts` and @README.md. `npm run build` must pass before any PR is considered complete. No test framework yet — skip test commands until one is added.

## Coding Style & Naming

- React components: named exports in PascalCase `.tsx` files.
- Style with Tailwind 4 utility classes directly in JSX `className`. No `@apply` unless extracting a repeated multi-class pattern.
- Lint & type rules: see @tsconfig.json (`strict: true`) and @eslint.config.mjs. Run `npm run lint` to verify.

## Commit & PR Guidelines

Observed convention: Conventional Commits — `<type>: <description>` (e.g. `chore: migrate from Astro to Next.js framework`). Use lowercase type prefixes: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `refactor`.

No CI pipeline is configured. Verify locally with `npm run build && npm run lint` before pushing.

## 10xDevs AI Toolkit - Module 2, Lesson 4

Prepare for a harder implementation stream with the **research-backed planning chain**:

```
internal research (/10x-research) + external research (exa.ai, Context7) -> /10x-plan -> /10x-implement -> success
```

The lesson focus is distinguishing internal from external research and using evidence to back planning decisions.

### Research discipline

- Internal research (`/10x-research`) answers "what does our codebase already do?" — patterns, schemas, conventions, integration points.
- External research (exa.ai, Context7) answers "what should we do?" — library capabilities, API docs, ecosystem best practices.
- Combine both as evidence-backed input to `/10x-plan`. A plan without research evidence on a non-trivial stream is a guess.
- Agent-friendly docs (`llms.txt`, markdown-for-agents, `/md` endpoints) are a quality signal for library selection — libraries that publish agent-readable docs integrate faster.

### `/10x-frame` as spare wheel

Three triggers for reaching for `/10x-frame`:

1. The plan won't converge — research keeps opening more questions instead of narrowing to a contract.
2. The plan doesn't deliver — implementation repeatedly fails to meet success criteria.
3. Persistent drift — the implementation keeps diverging from the plan in ways that suggest the problem was mis-framed.

Demonstrated on a Space Explorers example, not the SRS path. It is an escape hatch, not a mandatory step.

### Paths used by this lesson

- `context/changes/<change-id>/research.md` - internal research output
- `context/changes/<change-id>/frame.md` - framing output when needed
- `context/changes/<change-id>/plan.md` - evidence-backed implementation contract
- `context/foundation/lessons.md` - recurring rules and pitfalls

Skills must not write to `context/archive/`. Archived changes are immutable; if a resolved target path starts with `context/archive/`, abort with: "This change is archived. Open a new change with `/10x-new` instead."

# Agent Instructions

## Communication Style

- **Be short and clear.** Cut any sentence that doesn't add value.
- **Use simple words.** If a simpler word exists, use it.
- **No filler phrases.** Avoid things like _"Great question!"_, _"Certainly!"_, or long intros.

---

## How to Structure Answers

Use **titles and bullet points** to make content easy to scan:

- Short bullet points over long paragraphs
- One idea per bullet
- Bold key terms so they stand out

---

## Audience: Junior Developer First

- Explain like the reader is new to the topic
- Avoid assuming prior knowledge
- Define terms when you use them for the first time

**Going deeper:**
Only add advanced detail when the user asks for it (e.g. _"Can you explain more?"_ or _"How does X work under the hood?"_).

---

## Asset Creation Rules

Every file, snippet, or document you create must:

1. Have a **clear title** that says what it is
2. Start with a **1–2 sentence summary** of what it does
3. Use **comments** in code to explain non-obvious parts
4. Avoid unnecessary boilerplate or filler content

---

## Quick Checklist Before Every Response

- [ ] Is every sentence necessary?
- [ ] Would a junior dev understand this?
- [ ] Are titles and bullets used where helpful?
- [ ] Is it free of jargon (or are terms explained)?
